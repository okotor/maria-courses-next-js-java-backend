    0. Job Offers & ChatGPT 20 Key Skills Research: 

        - React, Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Redux, Zustand, Docker, REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, SQL (PostgreSQL), NoSQL (MongoDB), Python (Flask/FastAPI/Django), AWS/Azure/GCP (Cloud Storage), JWT Authentication, OAuth2.0 (Google Login), WebSockets (Real-time Communication), CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions).

    I. JWT & BE CODE UNDERSTAND

        1. FRONTEND LOGIN/REGISTER -> UserController (register, login, google login) -> ...

        2. FRONTEND REFRESH TOKEN / JWT TOKEN LOGIC
            a. Transform => AuthContext + api.js + LoginForm + course-action.js saveCourse -> no localStorage interaction but HttpOnly
                -> SecurityConfig -> JwtFilter -> JwtService -> MyUserDetailsService -> UserPrincipal
                -> RefreshTokenController -> JwtService
            b. Issue: The GoogleTokenValidatorService class creates a new GoogleIdTokenVerifier instance for each request.
                    Recommendation: Make the GoogleIdTokenVerifier instance a singleton to improve performance.
            c. Issue: The refreshToken method in JwtService does not validate the refresh token against the database.
                    Recommendation: Store refresh tokens in the database and validate them during the refresh process.
            d. Issue: The UserController does not handle errors properly during registration and login.
                    Recommendation: Implement error handling middleware to manage exceptions and provide user feedback.
                    This can be done by creating a custom error handler that catches exceptions and sends appropriate responses to the client.
                    
        3. User -> UserController (incorporate UseContrNew) -> JwtService
                                                            -> UserService + UserRepository -> GoogleTokenValidatorService
    II. FE CODE UNDERSTAND

        1. next.config.js -> jsconfig.json -> eslint.config.mjs

        2. .github -> .idea -> .next 

        3. app & components
        
    III. PORTFOLIO FIX
